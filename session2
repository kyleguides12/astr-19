# Python that prints the sum of two floating point numbers, the difference between two integers, and the product of a floating point number and an integer.
#In each case, have the program print out the data type of the resulting answer.

float1 = 12
float2 = 6
int1 = 20
int2 = 3

#Sum of two floating numbers
sum_floats = float1 + float2 
print(f"The sum of {float1} and {float2} is: {sum_floats}, and the data type is {type(sum_floats)}")

#Difference between two integers
difference_ints = int1 -  int2
print(f"The difference between {int1} and {int2} is: {difference_ints}")

#Product of floating number and integer
product_float_int = float1 * int1
print(f"The product of {float1} and {int1} is: {product_float_int}")
